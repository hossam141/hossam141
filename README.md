# Hey there! 👋 I'm Hossam Taha Mousa 🚀

### 🛠️ SRE | DevOps Wizard | Cloud Conjurer ☁️

Welcome to my chaotic yet highly optimized corner of the internet! I'm an **SRE** (which basically means I keep the internet from breaking... most of the time). I automate, orchestrate, and sprinkle some YAML magic to make sure things run smoothly in the cloud. ☁️✨

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (a.k.a My Bag of Tricks) 🎩🐇

- ☁️ **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure (where my money disappears 💸)
- 🐳 **Containers & Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker (because running stuff in prod should be *fun*)

- 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**: DataDog, Prometheus, Grafana (I see *everything* 👀)
- 🐍 **Languages**: Python, Bash, Groovy (when YAML isn’t enough to ruin my day)
